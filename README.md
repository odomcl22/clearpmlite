# ClearPM

ClearPM is a lightweight, structure-first project management framework designed
to reduce friction at the start of work and maintain momentum through execution.

Rather than adding complexity, ClearPM focuses on clarity, sequencing, and
repeatable structure—principles commonly used in effective project delivery but
often buried under tooling overhead.

## Core Ideas
- Frictionless project start
- Clear structure before execution
- Minimal ceremony
- Practical over performative project management
- AI-assisted framing, not AI dependency

## Current Status
This repository is an initial shell outlining the philosophy and direction of
ClearPM. Functional components will evolve through iterative development.

## Intended Use
ClearPM is designed for:
- Individuals managing complex work
- Small teams needing structure without overhead
- Organizations seeking consistent execution patterns

## Philosophy
Most projects fail at the start—not because of effort, but because of structure.
ClearPM exists to fix that.
